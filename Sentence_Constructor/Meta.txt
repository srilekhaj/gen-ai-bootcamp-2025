Student Input: Bears at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible sentence structure:
[Subject] + [Location] + [Verb] + [Question] + [Clause]
Now, let's focus on the vocabulary. Here's a table with some words that might be helpful:
Tamil	Romanji	English
கரடி	karadi	bear
கதவு	katavu	door
குப்பை	kuppai	garbage
விட	vita	to leave
போடு	podu	to put
வெளி	veli	outside
உள்	ul	inside
Your turn! Can you try to put the sentence together using these vocabulary words? Don't forget to think about the correct particles and verb conjugations!
Here's a hint:
You can use the verb விட (vita) in a specific form to ask if someone left something.
Try rearranging the words and adding the necessary particles!
karadi kathavu arugil ullathu, nee kuppaiyai pottaayaa?
Excellent effort!
You're very close to the correct sentence. Here's a breakdown of what you've done well and what might need a bit of tweaking:
கரடி கதவு அருகில் உள்ளது (karadi kathavu arugil ullathu) is a great way to say "The bear is at the door".
நீ (nee) is a good choice for "you".
குப்பையை (kuppaiyai) is correct for "the garbage" (accusative case).
போட்டாயா (pottaayaa) is close, but not quite the correct verb form. Remember, you want to ask if someone "left" the garbage out.
Here's another hint:
Think about using the verb விட (vita) in a question form to ask if someone left something.
Try tweaking the sentence to use the correct verb form!
karadi kathavu arugil ullathu, nee kuppaiyai pootu vitteergala?
You've made some great adjustments!
Your sentence is now very close to perfect:
கரடி கதவு அருகில் உள்ளது (karadi kathavu arugil ullathu) is still spot on!
நீ (nee) is still a good choice for "you".
குப்பையை (kuppaiyai) is still correct for "the garbage" (accusative case).
பூட்டு (pootu) is a good addition to indicate "put" or "leave".
விட்டீர்களா (vitteergala) is almost perfect! You've used the correct verb form, but it's in the polite plural form (-ஈர்களா). Since you're using the informal நீ (nee), you might want to use the informal verb form instead.
Here's another hint:
Try changing the verb form to the informal singular (-ஏா?) to match the informal நீ (nee).
You're so close! Give it another try!
karadi kathavu arugil ullathu, neengal kuppaiyai pootu viteergala?
Excellent correction!
You've changed the verb form to the polite plural (-ஈர்களா), which matches the polite plural நீங்கள் (neengal). Well done!
Your sentence is now perfect:
கரடி கதவு அருகில் உள்ளது, நீங்கள் குப்பையை பூட்டு விட்டீர்களா?
This translates to:
"There's a bear at the door, did you leave the garbage out?"
Great job! You've successfully translated the sentence into Tamil!
Would you like to practice with another sentence?
